	1. run_analysis.R - R script
	2. CodeBook.md containing the data variables
	3. tidy.txt - contains the final clean data
	
	R script - run.analysis.R
	
	The test and training activity details for 30 subjects are provided in a zip file.
	The input data (test and training) is distributed across various text files.
	
	The script merges the data based and produces a final consolidated data. 
	Finally, another independent tidy data set is created from the previous dataset 
	with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
